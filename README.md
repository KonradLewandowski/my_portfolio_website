# Getting Started with My Portfolio Website

The application was developed using üí•ReactJs and üí•Styled-components:

I kindly ask you to try out the functionalities of the application:

- Check the navbar on the bottom. It links to the sections on the page.

- "Let's talk" button will move you to the 'Contact' section (I invite you to try (‚óè'‚ó°'‚óè) ).

- "Download CV" is downloading my CV on your computer (the file is safe).

- 'About' section has three clickable button with the typing animation.

- Next secion is static with nice looking hover effect.

- My project has fancy multimedia tiles.

- The most important section - 'Contact'! You can contact with me using messenger, whatsapp, mail app or directly through the contact form.

## Available Scripts

Before you start instal all dependencies `npm i`
**If you have some problems with dependencies try to install with --legacy-peer-deps flag `npm i --legacy-peer-deps` or --force flag`npm i --force`(not recommended)**

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
