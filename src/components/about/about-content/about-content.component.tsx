      <p>
        For the past year I have focused on building and expanding my skills in the field
        of web development. Front-end, back-end, data bases and external APIâ€™s are some of
        the topics I have made myself familiar with. I would gladly become a part of a
        team of developers, from whom I can learn and further expand my abilities while
        working to achieve common objectives.
